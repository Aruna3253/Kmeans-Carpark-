#Car Spacing finder using Kmeans cluster(using scikit learn)  and  simply finding average through mean by explicitly defining the x position for each column.

1. The makesp.py file consists of code to draw rectangle inside the car parking image folder using opencv.
2. Then run succes.py - It is the simple code where I have explicitly defined 3 column and find the average between them.
3. try.py  - It is the alternative of  succes.py but here I have used K means clusturing to automatically detect the column and divide the total number of columns present in the car parking zone.

4. #Requirements:
Install scikit-learn
